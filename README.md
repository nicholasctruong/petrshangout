# Petr's Hangout

_"Who's the Anteater with 3 wives? Peter the Cheater!"_ _"Why are fish easy to weigh? Because they have their own scales."_ Whether you enjoy dad jokes or UCI-related jokes, with HackUCI in the middle of midterms season, we thought it'd be nice to have a fun chrome extension that people could use to cheer themselves up. As a result, we built Petr's Hangout!

Petr's Hangout is a chrome extension intended to lighten the mood for stressed out anteaters :) With it, users can access Petr cartoons, UCI-related jokes, dad jokes, and Kanye quotes at any time.

To use, find the extension in the chrome store under the name "Petr's Hangout." Once downloaded, click on the extension at any time and have fun using it!
